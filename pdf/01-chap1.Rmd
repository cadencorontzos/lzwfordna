This is for including Chapter 1.  Notice that it's also good practice to name your chunk.  This will help you debug potential issues as you knit.  The chunk above is called intro and the one below is called chapter1.  Feel free to change the name of the Rmd file as you wish, but don't forget to change it here from chap1.Rmd.

The {#rmd-basics} text after the chapter declaration will allow us to link throughout the document back to the beginning of Chapter 1.  These labels will automatically be generated (if not specified) by changing the spaces to hyphens and capital letters to lowercase.

# Backround and Motivations

This thesis deals with some high level topics and uses language specific to compression research. This chapter tries to give brief summaries and examples of the relevant topics to be discussed so readers of all experience levels can put our results into context.

## What is information?

  Suppose you had an idea that you wanted to share with another person. Humans have many ways to communicate information; you could send a text message, you could tell them with words, you could tell them with sign language. But regardless of the medium, you have some idea that you want to get across. Does it matter if the other person gets your message exactly? Or can it be part of the message? If someone asks you "Where library", despite the lack of prepositions you still understand what they mean. So did that person convey any less information than a person who asks "Where is the library?"
  Clearly, information is fundamental to how humans interact and how they understand the world, but defining it proves difficult. For our purposes, let us assume that information is something that can be interpreted to glean information that you didn't know before.

### Run Length Encoding

Run Length Encoding (RLE) is on of the simplest and most intuitive forms of compression. We can take advantage of redundant runs of characters in a sequence by just giving the number of times each character appears.
