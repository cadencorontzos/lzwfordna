This thesis gives an introduction to compression. Specifically, we focus on compressing DNA sequences using the Lepel Ziv Welch compression algorithm. We designed a data structure we deem the Direct Map Dictionary. The Direct Map Dictionary is indexed by file size and by a unique index for every possible string. We were also able to take advantage of the machine instruction `pext` to extract bits in parallel and make the indexing of strings even faster. We wrote a LZW implementation using this data structure, as well as another implementation which uses a greedy version of LZW and additional entropy encoding, which we call three stream LZW. We also implement an algorithm which trivially translates neucleotides to a two bit representation using `pext`, which we call Four to One. The Four to One version is extremely fast and achieves a compression ratio of 4.0 every time, which we believe could be useful in other applications with similar constraints. The Direct Map LZW is fast but doesn't have a great comression ratio, but the Three Stream LZW is able to achieve compression ratios greater than 4.0 on large files while still being fast.
