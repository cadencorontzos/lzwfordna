The Lempel Ziv Welch compression algorithm is a lossless data compression algorithm used for numerous applications, including the Unix file compression utility `compress` and the GIF image format. Storing, reading, and transferring enormous amounts of data is often an issue in the biological field, especially when concerning DNA. This thesis explores the application of Lempel Ziv Welch to the compression of DNA. A variety of different optimization of the original LZW algorithm are explore included palatalizing, multiple dictionaries, and some other cool thing here broh.
