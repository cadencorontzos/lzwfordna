# Optimizing LZW: Approach 

To restate the goal of this thesis, we seek to optimize LZW for use in compression of DNA. I chose to write in C++.

## Supporting Research

There has been several attempts to optimize LZW by computer science researchers.

## A Starting Point



## Techniques Used

I used several programming tools in order to access and optimize my code.

### Valgrind and Callgrind

### gprof 

### perf

## Trying Different Dictionaries

### Direct Map

### Multiple Indexed Dictionaries
