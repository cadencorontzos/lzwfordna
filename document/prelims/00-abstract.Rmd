 Large files containing DNA sequences can be bottlenecks for genetic research, as it can be very difficult to store and transfer gigabytes or even terabytes worth of genetic data. In this thesis, we focus on compressing DNA sequences using the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression algorithm. LZW relies heavily on a dictionary data structure, hindering its speed in compression. We propose a dictionary implementation we call the Direct Map Dictionary. Using the machine instruction `pext`, we were able to make the Direct Map Dictionary very fast and specifically tailored for DNA. Using this new data structure, we implement a greedy version of LZW we call Three Stream LZW which is able to compress large DNA files with a good compression ratio and notable speed, even when compared to professional tools.
